    ## The home page (landing page)

    *The landing page of the site (index) is the page that the visitor arrives at when he enters the URL of your website (without a specific .html file). This is often also referred to as the home or index page.*

    The purpose of this page is to give the audience of your pitch your opinion why you think the HBO-ICT programme and/or the ICT field suits you. As this page is only your own opinion, the content can never be wrong. At worst it can be incomplete. You are free in the way you want to demonstrate this. The challenge is to do it in an original way and use the available technology (HTML/CSS) to show what you have learned in the past period. 

    The page must contain at least:

    - 2 images
    - 2 links
    - 2 paragraphs of text
    - 1 list (ordered or unordered) or table.
