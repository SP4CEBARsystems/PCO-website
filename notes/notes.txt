Since 2015 I am a devout Christian. Christianity provides an answer for a problem all of
humanity has: We naturally do things we know are evil. Everyone has at least once broken Gods law and
there is nothing we can do about it anymore. Unless God intervened, and He did, He sent Jesus Christ to live life without
doing anything evil, Jesus then he died one of the worst deaths imaginable. Three days after He was buried He rose
from the dead. Through this, Jesus took the punishment for our sins upon Himself so that anyone who turns from their sins can be forgiven.

So many people try to earn The significance of Jesus Christ is that
it is a gift,
Here is a passage I would like to share
Jesus died a painful death although He did nothing wrong
Since then I started to hate the sins I once loved
I actually saw a great reduction in nightmares
The reason Jesus came was to pay the ransom
Jesus paid the price for our wrongdoings
Do not end up in hell. Jesus Christ died a
painful death to get your sins forgiven today!
