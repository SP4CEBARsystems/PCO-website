                        Since my first program in 2018 I have enjoyed programming. I have written many kinds of programs
                        in many languages, of which

                        I like the simplicity and reliability offered by HTML with javascript, allowing sophiscticated
                        online tools to be made.

                        My biggest project yet is my quest to generate personal plannings, I started in React Native,
                        now I am on my second attempt in HTML CSS and JavaScript. Hundreds of hours I have spent on it
                        so far, but I am finally getting somewhere.

    ## The (Personal) Dashboard

The purpose of this page is to create and maintain a clear overview of your study. This also shows to your student career coach that you have some detailed knowledge where you can find relevant information and what your activities in the coming year entail. The page contains at least the following parts:

The Study Monitor that shows the current status and progress of your study.

- It is based on an html `<table>` (or better, for example a CSS grid).
- All first-year test components (’things’ for which you received a grade, such as exams and portfolios) must be included.
- The test items must be grouped by course and quarter in chronological order.
- A clear distinction must be made between parts that have not yet been completed, sufficient parts (i.e. parts that have been obtained) and insufficient parts (still to be retaken). For example, by using colors.
- The completeness of your first year (the amount of obtained credits relative to the required amount of 60EC) must be clearly visible. This should also include the “NBSA boundary”.
- It must be easy to add grades and credits obtained (in the future).
