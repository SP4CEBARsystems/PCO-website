                        <p>
                            I am Boaz Crezee, a 21 years old amateur programmer, runner, and christian from Vlissingen.
                            As
                            far as I can remember I have been interested by, thinking about, developing, drawing, and or
                            building intricate systems, machines, and devices.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Running</h3>
                        <p>I like running, from around 2014 to 2023 I have been part of an Athletics club. Zeeland is
                            the
                            perfect place to run thanks to its flat terrain and beautiful coastline.</p>
                        <p>I've run Zeeland's coastal marathon in 2021 and in 2022, it is a 42-kilometer run from the
                            city of Burgh-Haemstede in Schouwen-Duiveland to the village Zoutelande in Walcheren. the
                            last 10
                            kilometers are tough, yet running a marathon is the experience of a lifetime.</p>

                        <h3>YouTube</h3>
                        <p>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SP4CEBAR/videos">YouTube channel</a> where I show
                            and explain electrical systems in 3D sandbox games
                            like Minecraft and Survivalcraft. Survivalcraft is about as old as Minecraft, but it has
                            more powerful electrical components. With them, I have made mechanical printers, text
                            screens, and other smart mechanical machines.</p>

                        <h3>Games</h3>
                        <p>I like playing games, of which:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minecraft,</li>
                            <li>Kerbal Space Program,</li>
                            <li>and Bloons TD 6.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Faith</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since 2015 I am a devout Christian. Christianity provides an answer for a problem all of
                            humanity has: We naturally do things we know are evil. Everyone has at least once broken Gods law and
                            there is nothing we can do about it anymore. Unless God intervened, and He did, He sent Jesus Christ to live life without
                            doing anything evil, Jesus then he died one of the worst deaths imaginable. Three days after He was buried He rose
                            from the dead. Through this, Jesus took the punishment for our sins upon Himself so that anyone who turns from their sins can be forgiven.
